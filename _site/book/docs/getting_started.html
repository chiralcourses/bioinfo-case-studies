<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>In this lecture, you will learn how to</p>

<ol>
  <li>get a Python environment up and running</li>
  <li>execute simple Python commands</li>
  <li>run a sample program</li>
  <li>install the code libraries that underpin these lectures</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="anaconda">Anaconda</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">core Python package</a> is easy to
install but <em>not</em> what you should choose for these lectures.</p>

<p>These lectures require the entire scientific programming ecosystem,
which</p>

<ul>
  <li>the core installation doesn't provide</li>
  <li>is painful to install one piece at a time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence the best approach for our purposes is to install a Python
distribution that contains</p>

<ol>
  <li>the core Python language <strong>and</strong></li>
  <li>compatible versions of the most popular scientific libraries.</li>
</ol>

<p>The best such distribution is
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/">Anaconda</a>.</p>

<p>Anaconda is</p>

<ul>
  <li>very popular</li>
  <li>cross-platform</li>
  <li>comprehensive</li>
  <li>completely unrelated to the Nicki Minaj song of the same name</li>
</ul>

<p>Anaconda also comes with a great package management system to organize
your code libraries.</p>

<pre><code class="language-{note}">All of what follows assumes that you adopt this recommendation!

<p>(install_anaconda)=</p>

<h3 id="installing-anaconda">Installing Anaconda</h3>

<p>To install Anaconda, <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">download</a> the
binary and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>Important points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Install the latest version!</li>
  <li>If you are asked during the installation process whether you'd like
to make Anaconda your default Python installation, say yes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="updating-anaconda">Updating Anaconda</h3>

<p>Anaconda supplies a tool called <code class="highlighter-rouge">conda</code> to manage and
upgrade your Anaconda packages.</p>

<p>One <code class="highlighter-rouge">conda</code> command you should execute regularly is the one
that updates the whole Anaconda distribution.</p>

<p>As a practice run, please execute the following</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open up a terminal</li>
  <li>Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">conda update anaconda</code></li>
</ol>

<p>For more information on <code class="highlighter-rouge">conda</code>, type <code class="highlighter-rouge">conda
help</code> in a terminal.</p>

<p>(ipython_notebook)=</p>

<h2 id="jupyter-notebooks">Jupyter Notebooks</h2>

<p><a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebooks are one of the many possible
ways to interact with Python and the scientific libraries.</p>

<p>They use a <em>browser-based</em> interface to Python with</p>

<ul>
  <li>The ability to write and execute Python commands.</li>
  <li>Formatted output in the browser, including tables, figures,
animation, etc.</li>
  <li>The option to mix in formatted text and mathematical expressions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of these features, Jupyter is now a major player in the
scientific computing ecosystem.</p>

While Jupyter isn\'t the only way to code in Python, it\'s great for
when you wish to

-   get started
-   test new ideas or interact with small pieces of code
-   share scientific ideas with students or colleagues


### Starting the Jupyter Notebook

Once you have installed Anaconda, you can start the Jupyter notebook.

Either

-   search for Jupyter in your applications menu, or
-   open up a terminal and type `jupyter notebook`
    - Windows users should substitute \"Anaconda command prompt\" for \"terminal\" in the previous line.

If you use the second option, you will see something like this

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/starting_nb.png
:scale: 50%
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The output tells us the notebook is running at <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:8888/</code></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost</code> is the name of the local machine</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">8888</code> refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_%28computer_networking%29">port number</a>
8888 on your computer</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus, the Jupyter kernel is listening for Python commands on port 8888 of our
local machine.</p>

<p>Hopefully, your default browser has also opened up with a web page that
looks something like this</p>

<p>```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb.png
:scale: 50%</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
What you see here is called the Jupyter *dashboard*.

If you look at the URL at the top, it should be `localhost:8888` or
similar, matching the message above.

Assuming all this has worked OK, you can now click on `New` at the top
right and select `Python 3` or similar.

Here\'s what shows up on our machine:

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb2.png
:scale: 50%
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The notebook displays an <em>active cell</em>, into which you can type Python
commands.</p>

<h3 id="notebook-basics">Notebook Basics</h3>

<p>Let's start with how to edit code and run simple programs.</p>

<h4 id="running-cells">Running Cells</h4>

<p>Notice that, in the previous figure, the cell is surrounded by a green
border.</p>

<p>This means that the cell is in <em>edit mode</em>.</p>

<p>In this mode, whatever you type will appear in the cell with the
flashing cursor.</p>

<p>When you're ready to execute the code in a cell, hit <code class="highlighter-rouge">Shift-Enter</code>
instead of the usual <code class="highlighter-rouge">Enter</code>.</p>

<p>```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb3.png
:scale: 50%</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
(Note: There are also menu and button options for running code in a cell
that you can find by exploring)

#### Modal Editing

The next thing to understand about the Jupyter notebook is that it uses
a *modal* editing system.

This means that the effect of typing at the keyboard **depends on which
mode you are in**.

The two modes are

1.  Edit mode
    -   Indicated by a green border around one cell, plus a blinking cursor
    -   Whatever you type appears as is in that cell
2.  Command mode
    -   The green border is replaced by a grey (or grey and blue) border
    -   Keystrokes are interpreted as commands --- for example, typing `b` adds a new cell below the current one

To switch to
-   command mode from edit mode, hit the `Esc` key or `Ctrl-M`
-   edit mode from command mode, hit `Enter` or click in a cell

The modal behavior of the Jupyter notebook is very efficient when you
get used to it.

#### Inserting Unicode (e.g., Greek Letters)

Python supports [unicode](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html),
allowing the use of characters such as $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as names in
your code.

In a code cell, try typing `\alpha` and then hitting the
`tab` key on your keyboard.

(a_test_program)=

#### A Test Program

Let\'s run a test program.

Here\'s an arbitrary program we can use:
&lt;http://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/gallery/pie_and_polar_charts/polar_bar.html&gt;.

On that page, you\'ll see the following code

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

# Fixing random state for reproducibility
np.random.seed(19680801)

# Compute pie slices
N = 20
θ = np.linspace(0.0, 2 * np.pi, N, endpoint=False)
radii = 10 * np.random.rand(N)
width = np.pi / 4 * np.random.rand(N)
colors = plt.cm.viridis(radii / 10.)

ax = plt.subplot(111, projection='polar')
ax.bar(θ, radii, width=width, bottom=0.0, color=colors, alpha=0.5)

plt.show()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Don't worry about the details for now — let's just run it and see
what happens.</p>

<p>The easiest way to run this code is to copy and paste it into a cell in
the notebook.</p>

<p>Hopefully you will get a similar plot.</p>

<h3 id="working-with-the-notebook">Working with the Notebook</h3>

<p>Here are a few more tips on working with Jupyter notebooks.</p>

<h4 id="tab-completion">Tab Completion</h4>

<p>In the previous program, we executed the line <code class="highlighter-rouge">import numpy as np</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>NumPy is a numerical library we'll work with in depth.</li>
</ul>

<p>After this import command, functions in NumPy can be accessed with
<code class="highlighter-rouge">np.function_name</code> type syntax.</p>

<ul>
  <li>For example, try <code class="highlighter-rouge">np.random.randn(3)</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can explore these attributes of <code class="highlighter-rouge">np</code> using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tab</code> key.</p>

<p>For example, here we type <code class="highlighter-rouge">np.ran</code> and hit Tab</p>

<p>```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb6.png
:scale: 50%</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
Jupyter offers up the two possible completions, `random` and `rank`.

In this way, the Tab key helps remind you of what\'s available and also
saves you typing.

(gs_help)=

#### On-Line Help

To get help on `np.rank`, say, we can execute `np.rank?`.

Documentation appears in a split window of the browser, like so

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb6a.png
:scale: 50%
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Clicking on the top right of the lower split closes the on-line help.</p>

<h4 id="other-content">Other Content</h4>

<p>In addition to executing code, the Jupyter notebook allows you to embed
text, equations, figures and even videos in the page.</p>

<p>For example, here we enter a mixture of plain text and LaTeX instead of
code</p>

<p>```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb7.png
:scale: 50%</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
Next we `Esc` to enter command mode and then type `m` to indicate that
we are writing [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
a mark-up language similar to (but simpler than) LaTeX.

(You can also use your mouse to select `Markdown` from the `Code`
drop-down box just below the list of menu items)

Now we `Shift+Enter` to produce this

```{figure} /_static/lecture_specific/getting_started/nb8.png
:scale: 50%
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="sharing-notebooks">Sharing Notebooks</h3>

<p>Notebook files are just text files structured in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> and typically ending with
<code class="highlighter-rouge">.ipynb</code>.</p>

<p>You can share them in the usual way that you share files — or by
using web services such as <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/">nbviewer</a>.</p>

<p>The notebooks you see on that site are <strong>static</strong> html representations.</p>

<p>To run one, download it as an <code class="highlighter-rouge">ipynb</code> file by clicking on the download
icon.</p>

<p>Save it somewhere, navigate to it from the Jupyter dashboard and then
run as discussed above.</p>
