# Python for Bioinformatics(PY4Bioinformatics)

This is a short sequence of notes on Python programming for scientific
work, specially in the field of bioinformatics written by [Jubayer Hossian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jubayer28/).


## About Python

## What\'s Python?

[Python](https://www.python.org) is a general-purpose programming
language conceived in 1989 by Dutch programmer [Guido van
Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum).

Python is free and open source, with development coordinated through the
[Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/).

Python has experienced rapid adoption in the last decade and is now one
of the most commonly used programming languages.

Popular textbooks on Python programming include {cite}`guttag2016introduction` and {cite}`hill2016learning`.


### Common Uses

Python is a general-purpose language used in almost all application domains
such as

-   communications
-   web development
-   CGI and graphical user interfaces
-   game development
-   data science
-   bioinformatics
-   multimedia, data processing, security, etc., etc., etc.

Python is beginner-friendly and routinely used to teach computer science and
programming in top computer science programs.

Python is particularly popular within the scientific and data science
communities.



### Features

Python is a [high-level language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language)
suitable for rapid development.

It has a relatively small core language supported by many libraries.

Multiple programming styles are supported (procedural, object-oriented, functional, etc.)

Python is interpreted rather than compiled.

### Syntax and Design

One nice feature of Python is its elegant syntax --- we\'ll see many
examples later on.

Elegant code might sound superfluous but in fact it\'s highly beneficial
because it makes the syntax easy to read and easy to remember.

Remembering how to read from files, sort dictionaries and other such
routine tasks means that you don\'t need to break your flow in order to
hunt down correct syntax.

Closely related to elegant syntax is an elegant design.

Features like iterators, generators, decorators and list comprehensions
make Python highly expressive, allowing you to get more done with less
code.

[Namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) improve
productivity by cutting down on bugs and syntax errors.


## Scientific Programming

Python has become one of the core languages of scientific computing.

It\'s either the dominant player or a major player in

-   [machine learning and data science](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
-   [astronomy](http://www.astropy.org/)
-   [artificial intelligence](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonForArtificialIntelligence)
-   [chemistry](http://chemlab.github.io/chemlab/)
-   [computational biology](http://biopython.org/wiki/Main_Page)
-   [meteorology](https://pypi.org/project/meteorology/)

Its popularity in economics is also beginning to rise.

These notes were built using the new Sphinx-based [Jupyter Book
2.0](https://beta.jupyterbook.org/intro.html) tool set, as part of the
[ExecutableBookProject](https://ebp.jupyterbook.org/en/latest/).  They are
intended mainly as a demonstration of these tools.
Instructions for how to build them from source can be found in the Jupyter
Book documentation.
